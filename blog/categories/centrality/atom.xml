    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I’d like to demonstrate a algorithm per computing the betweenness centrality which I have introduced in the previous post, for more details of what is Betweenness Centrality, and its measurements, please refer to my post <a href="/blog/2013/04/28/studying-notes-a-set-of-measures-of-centrality-based-on-betweenness/">A Set of Measures of Centrality Based on Betweenness</a>. </p>

<h4 id="definitions-and-notations">Definitions and notations</h4>

<p>Before getting down to the algorithm, first we briefly go through the definitions and notations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Betweenness Centrality</em></strong> is “the degree to which a point falls on the shortest path between others”, it’s the core of the algorithm. Although computing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem">shortest path</a> between point pair is essential to our problem, shortest path algorithm will not be the focus of this post. Readers interested in shortest path algorithm please refer to the shortest path on Wikipedia page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem">here</a>, kindly note that even if you have no knowledge of shortest path algorithm, it will not affect you reading this post.</p>

<p>In the next section, we use graph-theoretic terminology neutral to interpretation of notations.</p>

<p>Given a <em>directed graph</em> <script type="math/tex">\begin{smallmatrix} G = \left( V, E \right) \end{smallmatrix}</script>, consists of a set of $V$ of vertices and a set of $E \subseteq V \times V$ of <em>derected</em> edges.</p>

<p>Denote $\sigma(s, t)$ to the number of <em>shortest</em> $(s, t)$-paths, some times called geodesics, and let <script type="math/tex">\sigma(s,t \vert v)</script> be the number of shortest path which passing through certain vertex $v$ other than $s, t$, then the <em>betweenness centrality</em> $C_B(v)$ of vertex $v \in V$ is defined to be:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align}  C_B(v) = \sum\limits_{s,t \in V} \frac{\sigma(s,t \vert v)}{\sigma(s, t)} \end{align}</script>

<h4 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h4>
<p>As quoted from “On variants of shortest-path betweenness centrality and their computation”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Efficient computation of betweenness is based on the fact that the cubic number of <em>pair-wise dependencies <script type="math/tex">\delta(s,t \vert v) = \sigma(s, t \vert v)/ \sigma(s, t)</script></em> can be aggregated without computing all of them explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defining one-side dependencies:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\begin{align} \delta(s \vert v) = \sum\limits_{t \in V} \delta(s, t \vert v)\end{align}</script>,</p>

<p>per <script type="math/tex">\forall s, v \in V</script> we can exploit that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align} \delta(s \vert v) = \sum\limits_{w: (v, w) \in E  \ and \\\ dist(s, w) = dist(s, v) + 1} \left[ \frac{\sigma(s,v)}{\sigma(s, w)}
\times \left( 1 + \delta(s \vert w) \right) \right]
\end{align}</script>

<p>where $dist(s, t)$ denotes the minimum path length of point pair $(s, t)$.</p>

<p>The algorithm asserts that the dependency of a vertex $s$ on some $v$ can be compiled from dependencies on vertices <strong><em>one edge farther away</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Since $w$ is connected to $v$ and <strong>one edge farther away</strong> (which determined by <script type="math/tex">dist(s, w) = dist(s, v) + 1</script>) from $v$, so point $v$ is on the shortest paths of $(s, w)$ and the proportion of betweenness value that $v$ gains from edge $(v, w)$ equals to $\frac{\sigma(s,v)}{\sigma(s, w)} \times 1$; the other part of betweenness gain is from point $w$, that <script type="math/tex">\frac{\sigma(s,v)}{\sigma(s, w)} \times \delta(s \vert w)</script>, thus sum of the above two parts of betweenness gain is what exactly the equation demonstrates.</p>
